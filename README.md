# PTZ Camera Capture and Analysis System

This project is designed to control a PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera, capture images from predefined preset positions, process these images using a YOLO model to detect and count people, and send the results via email. The system supports parallel image processing for efficiency and logs all operations for debugging and monitoring.

## Features

- **REST API**: Simple HTTP API to trigger crowd counting and monitor status
- **Camera Control**: Communicates with a PTZ camera using VISCA commands over a socket connection.
- **Image Capture**: Captures images from specified preset positions via HTTP requests.
- **Object Detection**: Uses a YOLO model to detect people in captured images.
- **Clustering**: Applies DBSCAN clustering to count distinct groups of people.
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes images concurrently using multiprocessing.
- **Result Compilation**: Saves annotated images and counts to a CSV file.
- **Email Notification**: Zips results and sends them via email using the Mailtrap API.

## Requirements

### Docker (Recommended)
- Docker installed on your system
- A PTZ camera accessible over a network with VISCA protocol support
- **Note**: YOLO model is automatically downloaded from CDN - no manual setup needed!

### Local Installation
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A PTZ camera accessible over a network with VISCA protocol support
- A trained YOLO model for person detection (e.g., `best.pt`)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

Environment variables can be set in a `.env` file or directly in your system. Below are the configurable parameters:

- `CAMERA_IP`: IP address of the PTZ camera (default: none, must be set)
- `VISCA_PORT`: Port for VISCA commands (default: `5678`)
- `CAMERA_USER`: Camera username (default: none, must be set)
- `CAMERA_PASS`: Camera password (default: none, must be set)
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the YOLO model file (default: `models/best.pt`)
- `INFER_CONF`: Confidence threshold for YOLO inference (default: `0.25`)
- `INFER_IOU`: IoU threshold for YOLO inference (default: `0.45`)
- `CLUSTER_EPS`: DBSCAN epsilon parameter for clustering (default: `50`)
- `MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE`: Minimum cluster size for DBSCAN (default: `2`)
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for processing (default: `4`)
- `NUM_WORKERS`: Number of worker processes (default: `4`)
- `EMAIL_SENDER`: Sender email address for results (default: none, must be set)
- `EMAIL_RECEIVER`: Receiver email address for results (default: none, must be set)
- `EMAIL_API`: Mailtrap API token (default: none, must be set)
- `PRESET_CONFIG_FILE`: Path to preset configuration JSON file (default: `preset_config.json`)

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
CAMERA_IP=192.168.x.x
CAMERA_USER=your_camera_username
CAMERA_PASS=your_camera_password
EMAIL_RECEIVER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_API=your_mailtrap_api_token
```

## Preset Configuration

Presets are loaded from a JSON file specified by `PRESET_CONFIG_FILE`. The file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    { "number": 1, "name": "Entrance" },
    { "number": 2, "name": "Hallway" }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run this application is using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull cwhitio/crowd-counter:latest

# Run with environment variables
docker run -d --name crowd-counter \
  -e CAMERA_IP=192.168.1.100 \
  -e CAMERA_USER=admin \
  -e CAMERA_PASS=password \
  -e EMAIL_RECEIVER=your_email@example.com \
  -e EMAIL_API=your_mailtrap_api_token \
  -v ./models:/app/models \
  -v ./output:/app/output \
  cwhitio/crowd-counter:latest

# The container starts with an API server automatically
# Access the web API at http://localhost:8000

# Trigger crowd counting via API (Recommended)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/start

# Check process status
curl http://localhost:8000/status

# View detailed logs  
curl http://localhost:8000/logs

# Alternative: Execute directly in container
docker exec crowd-counter python run.py

# Update the application from GitHub
docker exec crowd-counter python update.py
```

## API Endpoints

The application includes a REST API server that starts automatically on port 8000:

### Available Endpoints

- **GET /** - Service information and available endpoints
- **GET /health** - Detailed health check with system status
- **POST /start** - Start the crowd counting process
- **POST /trigger** - Alternative endpoint to start counting
- **POST /update** - Update application from GitHub
- **GET /status** - Check current process status
- **GET /logs** - Get process logs and output

### API Usage Examples

**Linux/macOS (curl):**
```bash
# Start crowd counting
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/start

# Check process status
curl http://localhost:8000/status

# Get detailed logs
curl http://localhost:8000/logs

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Update from GitHub
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/update
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Start crowd counting
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/start" -Method POST

# Check process status  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/status" -Method GET

# Get detailed logs
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/logs" -Method GET

# Health check
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health" -Method GET

# Update from GitHub  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/update" -Method POST

### Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  crowd-counter:
    image: cwhitio/crowd-counter:latest
    container_name: crowd-counter
    environment:
      - CAMERA_IP=192.168.1.100
      - CAMERA_USER=admin
      - CAMERA_PASS=password
      - EMAIL_RECEIVER=your_email@example.com
      - EMAIL_API=your_mailtrap_api_token
    volumes:
      - ./models:/app/models
      - ./output:/app/output
      - ./data:/app/data
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# API server starts automatically - trigger via web API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/start
```

### Running Locally

Run the script to start capturing and processing images from the camera presets:

```bash
python run.py
```

- The script will create an output directory with a timestamp (e.g., `output/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`).
- Raw images, annotated images, and a CSV file with counts will be generated.
- Results are zipped and emailed to the configured recipient.

## Output Structure

- `output/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
  - `annotated_images/`: Images with detection annotations
  - `results/count_results.csv`: CSV file with preset numbers, names, and people counts
  - `ptz_capture_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip`: Zipped results sent via email

## Logging

Logs are saved to `ptz_capture.log` in the project directory and also printed to the console for real-time monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera Connection Issues**: Ensure the camera IP and port are correct, and the camera supports VISCA commands.
- **Image Capture Failures**: Verify camera credentials and network connectivity.
- **Email Sending Errors**: Check Mailtrap API token and recipient email configuration.
- **Processing Errors**: Ensure the YOLO model path is correct and the model is trained for person detection.
